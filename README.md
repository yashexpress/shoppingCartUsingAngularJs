# shoppingCartUsingAngularJs
Shopping cart project using all components of AngularJs.
Here I've used AngularJs components such as:
1) App.js
2) Controller
3) Services
4) Directives.

Note: Just for the sake of time, I've used mock values for now but you can all connect your backend application to pull in data using Rest API as well
